STEPS FOR IMPLEMENTATOPN

1) download any python code editor (I used pycharm)

2) open the modules_required.txt file and install all the modules in your terminal

3) open the .py file in your code editor


I have loaded some of the coolest cammands

-> opening many websites

-> opening applications on our laptop

-> sending automatic emails

-> sending automatic whatsapp message

-> translating audio from english to any other language

-> controling the computer screen through hand

-> playing songs on youtube

-> other general commads


STEPS TO FOLLOW

- Once you run the code first the assistant will greet you

- Then wait till the text listening... to show up in your output window

- Then give command (I have only loaded the above commands, so please give the commands related to those)

- Then bases on your command the appropriate output will come

- sometimes there might be an exception, in that case the assistant will say 'can you repeat again' 

- In that case just give command again

- The assistant will keep on taking the command as long as you want

- when you want to terminate the assistant just say 'shutdown'
